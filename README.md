# EQPlatform-PulseGuiding
This is a private project, that I am currently working on. The project contains the firmware for an AVR microcontroller and an INDI driver. The firmware controls the homemade equatorial platform and the INDI driver is used to let the ÂµC communicate with guiding tools such as Ekos (Kstars) or PHD2. (This feature is work in progress.)
It should also work with various other homemade mounts (eg. barn door trackers...)

The microcontroller firmware was ported to Rust, thanks to Rahix's amazing work on AVR HAL. The guiding pulses aren't implemented into the firmware yet.
### Building
#### AVR Hex File
See [Rahix's AVR HAL Readme](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal#readme) to learn how to setup the Rust development environment for AVR microcontrollers.
To build the project run
```
cargo build --release
```

The .elf file will be in `./target/avr-atmega328p/release`. Use avr-objcopy to turn the .elf file to a Intel HEX file that can be used to flash the microcontroller using avrdude.

Also you can use a bootloader (for example [FastBoot from Peter Dannegger](http://pointless-circuits.com/fastboot-generator/)) instead of flashing the hex file directly to the microcontroller. This way flashing can be done using the serial port.
#### INDI driver
The INDI driver is fairly simple. Just grab the compiled binary file and put it in your /usr/bin folder, if you have indi already installed. But if you want to build the driver by yourself, just follow this instruction to set up the development environment:
[INDI manual](https://www.indilib.org/develop/developer-manual/163-setting-development-environment.html "Official development manual of INDI")

You need to add this projects source files to the CMake list, so that it can be compiled.
Be careful whenever you run a 'sudo make install'.
Run
```
sudo make install
```
in {indi base dir}/build after you have set up your CMake Build files (see [INDI manual](https://www.indilib.org/develop/developer-manual/163-setting-development-environment.html "Official development manual of INDI")) This will compile all drivers and it puts the binary files into /usr/bin/.
### Using the INDI driver
To run the indiserver type
```
indiserver -v indi_eq_platform
```
Ekos or PHD2 should now be able to connect to the driver and send guiding instructions to the mount.
